# Learn x86 Assembly on a Mac

* Are you trying to read [*x86-64 Assembly Language Programming with Ubuntu*][1]?
* Are you on a Mac?
* **This Repo's for You**

### Setup
1. Install [Homebrew][3] if you don't already have it
2. `brew cask install docker`
3. Run `make hello.test`

### How It Works
The [Makefile][5] sets up a Docker container running the appropriate version of Ubuntu for you to
follow along with [Jorgensen's book][1]. The `yasm`, `ld`, and `gdb` commands are all executed
inside the container, but you can still edit your source files (and see the output!) from your Mac.
Thanks to Docker's adoption of Apple's [Hypervisor][6], we don't actually have to acknowledge that
there's a virtual machine here! ðŸŽ‰

### Doing Your Own Thing
1. Write your program in `whatever.s`
2. Write your [GDB Script][4] in `whatever.gdb`
3. Run `make whatever.test`
